		<h3> 
			Scotch. Disaronno. Lemon. Sugar.
		</h3>

		<h2>
			Sazerac
		</h2>
		<h3> 
			Rye Whiskey. Herbsaint. Peychaud's Bitters. Sugar.
			</h3>
		<p>
			Some call it the original cocktail. A New Orleans staple, made many ways over the years, we recreate this drink with the absinthe-like Herbsaint, in the fashion of the aptly-named Sazerac Bar in New Orleans. 
		</p>
				<h2>
			Whiskey Sour
		</h2>
		<h3> 
			Bourbon. Lemon. Sugar. 
			</h3>
		<p>
			Strong, sour, and just the right amount of sweet. This is how we like ours. 
		</p>
				<h2>
			Vieux Carre
		</h2>
		<h3> 
			Brandy. Rye. Sweet Vermouth. Benedictine. Peychaud's Bitters. Angostura Bitters. 
			</h3>
		<p>
			Translating to "Old Quarter", this referrs to the French Quarter of New Orleans. A lesser-known classic, it's a strong but surprisingly balanced and complex drink. 
		</p>
				<h2>
			Rum and Coke
		</h2>
		<h3> 
			Rum. Coke.
			</h3>
		<p>
			If you add a lime wedge, you call it a 'Cubalibre'. Here's to a free Cuba. 
		</p>
		<h2>
			Ramos Gin Fizz
		</h2>
		<h3> 
			Gin. Lemon-Lime Sour. Cream. Egg White. Fizz.
	  </h3>
		<p>
			This creamy yet refreshing drink is a unique but classic cocktail. It's a bit labor-intensive, and at the peak of its 20th-century popularity dozens of bartenders could be found shaking this drink in relays in New Orleans bars.
